This project leverages the power of AI to create a sophisticated PDF chatbot. By combining the capabilities of Streamlit, PyPDF2, LangChain, and Google Generative AI, this application enables users to interact with PDF documents in a conversational manner. Users can upload PDF files, ask questions, and receive comprehensive answers directly from the text within the documents. The underlying technology involves text extraction, vectorization, and advanced language modeling to provide accurate and informative responses. This innovative solution has the potential to revolutionize how we interact with and extract information from PDF documents, making it a valuable tool for researchers, students, and professionals alike.
